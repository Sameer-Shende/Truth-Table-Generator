# Truth Table Generator

This project is a simple web-based truth table generator. Users can input a logical expression with the operators `∧` (AND), `∨` (OR), `∼` (NOT), and `→` (IMPLIES), and the tool will generate the corresponding truth table.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Buttons are provided for inserting logical operators, making it easy to construct expressions.
- **Real-Time Validation**: The expression is validated as you type, ensuring that only correct logical expressions are processed.
- **Responsive Design**: The table is centered and scrolls horizontally if it overflows, without increasing the size of the outer container.
- **Expression Support**: Supports multiple variables and logical operators with automatic conversion from infix to postfix notation.

## Usage

1. **Enter Expression**: Input a logical expression in the text field.
2. **Use Buttons**: Click the operator buttons to insert operators into the expression.
3. **Submit**: Click the "Submit" button to generate the truth table.
